pypreprocess
============
**pypreprocess** is a collection of python scripts for preprocessing fMRI data (motion correction, spatial normalization, smoothing, ...). It provides:

* the possibility to run processing pipelines using simple text-based configuration-files, allowing to analyse data without programming;
* automatic generation of html reports, for example for quality assurance (e.g. spatial registration checks), statistical results, etc.;
* parallel processing of multiple subjects on multi-core machines;
* persistence of intermediate stages: in case an analysis is interrupted, cached intermediates files are reused to speed up processing;
* support for precompiled SPM (besides the usual matlab-dependent flavor).

pypreprocess relies on nipype's interfaces to SPM (both precompiled SPM  and matlab-dependent SPM flavors). It also has pure-Python (no C extensions, no compiled code, just Python) modules and scripts for slice-timing correction, motion correction, coregistration, and smoothing, without need for nipype or matlab.

Then install pypreprocess itself by running:

       python setup.py install --user


Getting started: pypreprocess 101
=================================
Simply ``cd`` to the ``examples/easy_start/`` sub-directory and run the following command:

       python spm_auditory_preproc.ini


Layout of examples
==================
We have written some examplary scripts for preprocessing some popular datasets.
The **examples** directory contains a set of scripts, each demoing an aspect of pypreprocessing. Some scripts even provide use-cases for the nipy-based GLM. The examples use publicly available sMRI and fMRI data. Data fetchers are based on the nilearn API.
The main examples scripts can be summarized as follows:

Very easy examples
------------------
* **examples/easy_start/nipype_preproc_spm_auditory.py**: demos preprocessing + first-level GLM (using nipy)  on the single-subject SPM auditory dataset.

* **examples/easy_start/nipype_preproc_spm_haxby.py**: preprocessing of the 'Haxby2001' visual recognition task fMRI dataset.

More advanced examples
----------------------
* **examples/pipeline/nipype_preproc_spm_multimodal_faces.py**: demos preprocessing + first-level fixed-effects GLM on R. Henson's multi-modal face dataset (multiple sessions)

* **examples/pipeline/nipy_glm_fsl_feeds_fmri.py**: demos preprocessing + first-level GLM on FSL FEEDS dataset

* **examples/pipeline/nipype_preproc_spm_nyu.py**: preprocessing of NYU resting-state dataset

Examples using pure Python (no SPM, FSL, etc. required)
-------------------------------------------------------
* **examples/pure_python/slice_timing_demos.py, examples/realign_demos.py, examples/coreg_demos.py**: demos Slice-Timing Correction (STC), motion-correction, and coregistration on various datasets, using modules written in pure Python

* **examples/pure_python/pure_python_preproc_demo.py**: demos intra-subject preprocessing using pure Python modules, on single-subject SPM auditory dataset


Using .ini configuration files to specify pipeline
==================================================

It is possible (and recommended) to configure the preprocessing pipeline just by copying any of the `.ini` configuration files under the `examples` sub-directory and modifying it (usually, you only need to modify the `dataset_dir` parameter), and then run

      `python pypreprocess.py your.ini`
      
For example,

      `python pypreprocess.py examples/easy_start/spm_auditory_preproc.ini`


Pipelines
=========
We have put in place two main pipelines for preprocessing: the *standard* pipeline, and the *DARTEL*-based pipeline. In the end of either method, each subject's EPI data has been corrected for artefacts, and placed into the same reference space (MNI).
When you invoke the ``do_subjects_preproc(..)`` API of [nipype_preproc_spm_utils.py](https://github.com/neurospin/pypreprocess/blob/master/nipype_preproc_spm_utils.py) to preprocess a dataset (group of subjects), the default pipeline used is the standard one; passing the option ``do_dartel=True`` forces the DARTEL-based pipeline to be used.
Also you can fine-tune your pipeline using the the various supported parameters in you .ini file (see the ``examples/`` subdirectory for examples).

Standard pipeline
-----------------
For each subject, the following preprocessing steps are undergone:

* Motion correction is done to estimate and correct for subject's head motion during the acquisition.

* The subject's anatomical image is coregistered against their fMRI images (precisely, to the mean thereof). Coregistration is important as it allows deformations of the anatomy to be directly applicable to the fMRI, or for ROIs to be defined on the anatomy.

* Tissue Segmentation is then employed to segment the anatomical image into GM, WM, and CSF compartments by using TPMs (Tissue Probability Maps) as priors.

* The segmented anatomical image are then warped into the MNI template space by applying the deformations learned during segmentation. The same deformations have been applied to the fMRI images.

DARTEL pipeline
---------------
Motion correction, and coregistration go on as for the standard pipeline. The only difference is the way the subject EPI are warped into MNI space. viz:
* Group/Inter-subject Normalization is done using the SPM8 [DARTEL](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/SPM8_Release_Notes.pdf) to warp subject brains into MNI space. The idea is to register images by computing a “flow field” which can then be “exponentiated” to generate both forward and backward deformations. Processing begins with the “import” step. This involves taking the parameter files produced by the segmentation (NewSegment), and writing out rigidly transformed versions of the tissue class images, such that they are in as close alignment as possible with the tissue probability maps.   The next step is the registration itself. This involves the simultaneous registration of e.g. GM with GM, WM with WM and 1-(GM+WM) with 1-(GM+WM) (when needed, the 1- (GM+WM) class is generated implicitly, so there is no need to include this class yourself). This procedure begins by creating a mean of all the images, which is used as an initial template. Deformations from this template to each of the individual images are computed, and the template is then re-generated by applying the inverses of the deformations to the images and averaging. This procedure is repeated a number of times.  Finally, warped versions of the images (or other images that are in alignment with them) can be generated.
[nipype_preproc_spm_abide.py](https://github.com/neurospin/pypreprocess/blob/master/abide/nipype_preproc_spm_abide.py) is a script which uses this pipeline to preprocess the [ABIDE](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/).

Intra-subject preprocessing in pure Python (with no compiled code, etc.)
========================================================================
A couple of modules for intra-subject preprocessing (slice-timing correction, motion-correction, coregistration, etc.)
in pure (only using builtins and numpy/scipy official stuff, no compiled code, no wrappers) Python have been implemented.
To demo this feature, simply run the following command:

       python examples/pure_python/pure_python_preproc_demo.py
